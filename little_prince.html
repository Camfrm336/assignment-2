      <p>
        As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set
        out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me
        that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.
        <span class="orange-bg">
          It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all
          Earth.
        </span>
        In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his
        locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
        <span class="red-text">
          "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is
          invisible...‚Äù
        </span>
        As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said
        to myself, again:
        <span class="red-text">
          "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping
          here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines
          through his whole being like a flame of a lamp, even when he is
          asleep..."
        </span>
        And I felt home to be more fragile still.
        <span class="underlined-text">
          I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that
          might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .
